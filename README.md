# Week 2 - Distributed class

## Preparation 
### Git 
Set your email and username:

```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

### Get the code
Fork this repo, then clone your fork locally

## Practice - ~45 min

What would you like to work on?
* Variables - strings, numbers, etc
* Functions - how do they work, examples
* Classes & Objects
* Handling exceptions - raise, rescue e.t.c.
* Loops
* Arrays and hashes (looping with blocks)
* Blocks - creating your own <- advanced, we can cover them next week

## Reading and Writting to Files - ~45 min
* Reading
* Writing
* Practice

## Refactoring Demo - ~45 min

Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code – changing the factoring – without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve source code maintainability and create a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility. Typically, refactoring applies a series of standardised basic micro-refactorings, each of which is (usually) a tiny change in a computer program's source code that either preserves the behaviour of the software, or at least does not modify its conformance to functional requirements.

Reference - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring

In short - refactoring is cleaning up code wihtout changing its behaviour.

##### QI type information
Definitions:
factor - one of the elements contributing to a particular result or situation

factoring - the act or process of separating an equation, formula, cryptogram, etc., into its component parts.

Ref: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/factoring

In software development, we break up a large problem into smaller ones - this can be called factoring (although it is not a commonly used term). After breaking up the problem and implimenting the solution, we might see ways of improving the solution without changing the functionality. The act of improving the internal design is known as re-factoring.
